### Configuration

Any project referencing `float` must configure the Float credentials: create a `float.credentials` file in the resources folder (where
`float.credentials.sample` is located and add your Float OAuth token there. You can use the `float.credentials.sample` as a starting point:
`cp float.credentials.sample float.credentials`).
