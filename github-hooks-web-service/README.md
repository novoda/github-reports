github-hooks-web-service
========================

_Web Service for the github webhooks to hit._

-----------

**WIP**
This Web Service is to contain an AWS lambda, to be exposed through AWS API Gateway. The aim is to configure the
[webhooks](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/) for your organisation so they hit this API with events (containing data). This data is to be
parsed and stored appropriately.
